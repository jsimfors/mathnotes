## Mathnotes
A website I built to easily distribute my material to my students, in my work as a math teaching assistant. 

##### Long story short, I thought the page used by the school had too much friction. I mean, for many, these math classes are pretty complicated in their pure form - surely the student's should not have to also work this hard just to reach the material? After using the provided service for half a semester - I built this page instead! :-) Have a look at the page yourself at [kthmatte.web.app](http://kthmatte.web.app/)

## Development
#### The page is built in ReactJS and styled wih Bootstrap and Material UI. The page is hosted through Firebase.
